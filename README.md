# LearnLabFinal
CS320 Fall 2016 Group Project with Annie Wang and Ruby Feng

index.js contains code that connects to a serial port and uses command-line to grab data from a sensor attached to an arduino board.
sketch_FINAL.ino is an arduino sketch that takes data from the pressure sensors/button and sends it to the serial port. 
The public folder contains the 'program' that runs the lab procedure and takes data from the serial port. 
index.html is the first page and a user navigates using the next and back buttons. Node_modules is a folder with code that lets you communicate
with and extract information from the serial port.
